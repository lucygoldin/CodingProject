<h1>About Broadway</h1>
<p>Broadway theatre,commonly known as Broadway, refers to the theatrical performances presented in the 41 professional
theatres
<br>
with 500 or more seats located in the Theater District and Lincoln Center along Broadway,
in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.
<br>
Along with London's West End theatre, Broadway theatre is widely considered to represent the highest level
<br>
of commercial theatre in the English-speaking world.</p>

<p>The Theater District is a popular tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the
<br>
2016â€“2017 season (which ended May 21, 2017), total attendance was 13,270,343 and Broadway shows had US$1,449,399,149
<br>
in grosses, with attendance down 0.4%, grosses up 5.5%, and playing weeks down 4.1%.</p>

<p>The great majority of Broadway shows are musicals. Historian Martin Shefter argues, "'Broadway musicals,' culminating
<br>
in the productions of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, became enormously influential forms of American popular culture"
<br>
and helped make New York City the cultural capital of the nation.</p>
